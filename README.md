## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass
- Javascript

### What I learned

I learned how to manipulate DOM elements using Javascript. At first I hard coded everything but then I wanted to challenge myself and use the provided JSON file to generate the appropriate HTML.
**NOTE** - I don't believe the categories and their scores show up in firefox due to Firefox not supporting import assertions. I would like to look into other ways to do this while maintaining compatibility.

### Continued development

I plan on working with Javascript more so I can continue to get more and more comfortable with it.

### Useful resources

- [Javascript Tutorial](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-dom/) - This helped me gain a better understanding on the Javascript DOM, and helped me create a script to generate then html from the provided JSON file.
- [CSS Reference](https://cssreference.io/) - This site helped me by refreshing me on the usage of various css attributes and properties.
